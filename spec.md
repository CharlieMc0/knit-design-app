# Knitting Chart Maker Application Specification

## 1. Overview

This web-based application is designed for both professional knitters and hobbyists to create complex knitting patterns quickly and efficiently. Unlike current solutions that require clicking on each individual cell, our application will support intuitive multi-cell editing, shape drawing, and real-time mirror/reflection features. Initially built as a single-user application (with future capabilities to share components and designs across sessions), the tool will run locally using basic HTML and JavaScript, with a minimalistic UI to ensure the design doesnâ€™t distract from the creative process.

## 2. Objectives

- **Accelerate Workflow:** Enable users to design complex patterns and make quick edits without laborious cell-by-cell modifications.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Provide tools that support multi-cell selection, batch editing, shape drawing, and mirror/reflection functionality.
- **High Customizability:** Support up to 12 user-defined colors and allow easy copying/pasting of entire sections or shapes.
- **Platform Agnostic:** Develop as a web application optimized for desktops and tablets, with an emphasis on local execution.

## 3. Key Features & Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Interactive Canvas & Grid
- **Dynamic Grid:**  
  - Users can create a grid of adjustable size to design their knitting charts.
  - The grid should be scalable and zoomable for detailed work.

- **Multi-Cell Selection:**  
  - Enable selection through click-and-drag, shift-click, and keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+C for copy, Ctrl+V for paste).
  - Allow batch editing to change cell colors and adjust the size of a selection (e.g., shrink/grow the selected area).

### 3.2 Copy & Paste Functionality
- **Section & Shape Replication:**  
  - Allow users to copy entire sections or pre-designed shapes.
  - Enable pasting within the same design session.
  - Future iterations may allow storing and reusing components across sessions.

### 3.3 Color Management
- **Multiple Colors Support:**  
  - Allow the use of up to 12 colors per design.
  - Provide a color picker where users can define and adjust their palette.
  - Maintain a minimal UI so that the color tools do not distract from the chart design.

### 3.4 Drawing Tools & Shape Support
- **Shape Drawing Tools:**  
  - Support basic geometric shapes: rectangles, circles, lines, and freeform drawing.
  - All drawn shapes must be editable post-creation:
    - **Resizable:** Adjust dimensions.
    - **Repositionable:** Move shapes without having to redraw.

### 3.5 Mirror/Reflect Designs
- **Mirror & Reflection Options:**  
  - Offer options to mirror or reflect designs across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes.
  - Provide a togglable real-time update feature so that as users edit their design, the mirrored section updates accordingly.
  - Users should be able to choose which axis to mirror across through a simple UI toggle.

### 3.6 Export Functionality
- **PDF Export:**  
  - Provide the ability to export the completed design as a PDF.
  - Ensure that the exported PDF preserves the exact design layout and colors.

### 3.7 Sharing Patterns
- **Pattern Sharing:**  
  - Although the application is primarily single-user for MVP, include functionality to share designs (e.g., generating a shareable file or URL) for future community or personal distribution.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Usability & Performance
- **Ease-of-Use:**  
  - The UI should be intuitive, with a minimalistic design that emphasizes functionality.
  - The application must be responsive and optimized for both desktop and tablet devices.
  
- **Performance:**  
  - Ensure that operations like multi-cell selection, shape rendering, and mirror updates occur smoothly without lag.
  
### 4.2 Technical Constraints & Future Extensibility
- **Tool Stack:**  
  - Built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - The application should be capable of running locally without dependency on a heavy backend.
  - Future integrations (e.g., static backend for data persistence, databases) should be considered, but are not required for MVP.
  
- **Extensibility:**  
  - Codebase should be modular to allow for future features such as cross-session component sharing and collaborative editing.

## 5. Architecture & Technical Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Core languages for a lightweight, locally executed application.
  - **Canvas/Grid Library:** Use either a custom-built solution or a lightweight library to handle the dynamic grid and shape drawing.
  - **Event Handling:** Implement event listeners for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions to support multi-cell selection and editing.

- **Export Functionality:**  
  - Consider using a client-side PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF) to export the chart designs accurately.

- **Future Backend Considerations:**  
  - Although MVP is local, design the architecture with clear separation between the presentation layer and potential backend services.
  - Ensure that any data (such as user settings or saved designs) can be easily migrated to a persistent storage solution in later versions.

## 6. UI/UX Guidelines

- **Minimalist Design:**  
  - The interface should be clean with an emphasis on the chart and design tools.
  - Use a neutral color scheme to ensure that the chart colors are the main focus.
  
- **Responsive Layout:**  
  - Design should accommodate both desktop and tablet use with adjustable layouts and touch-friendly controls.
  
- **Tool Panel:**  
  - A side or top panel with easy access to drawing tools, color picker, mirror/reflection toggles, and export options.
  - Shortcuts and context menus to facilitate quick editing actions.

## 7. Development Roadmap

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Interactive canvas with adjustable grid.
- Basic multi-cell selection (click-and-drag, shift-click).
- Copy & paste functionality within the same session.
- Support for up to 12 colors with user-defined palette.
- Basic drawing tools (rectangles, circles, lines, freeform).
- Editable shapes (resizable and repositionable).
- Mirror/reflection functionality with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal options (toggable real-time updates).
- PDF export of designs.
- Basic design sharing (e.g., downloadable file or URL generation).

### Future Iterations
- Cross-session component sharing (copying/pasting between projects).
- Enhanced collaboration features (if demand arises).
- Backend integration for persistent storage.
- Advanced shape manipulation and additional drawing tools.
- Enhanced export options (other file formats, advanced PDF options).

## 8. Conclusion

This specification outlines the vision for a next-generation knitting chart maker application that significantly improves upon current tools. By focusing on intuitive multi-cell editing, flexible design tools, and a streamlined user interface, the application is positioned to become a valuable tool for both professional knitters and enthusiasts. The MVP will focus on local execution with basic web technologies, ensuring rapid development while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
