# Knitting Chart Maker

Built after a conversation with my girlfriend about how the existing tools for designing knitting patters can be tedious. Using Cursor we built a new app that prioritizes the ability to quickly deisgn colorwork patterns with simple timesaving features like draw shapes, reflect, repositioning layers, etc. Things that seemed to be missing in the existing apps. 

Purposely kept this very simple. Design can be saved locally in a JSON format and uploaded as needed. The page is stateless and does not save progress between visits.
